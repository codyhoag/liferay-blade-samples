What does this sample accomplish?

The BLADE Language sample displays the Liferay recommended approach to sharing language keys through OSGI services. This particular sample provides a resource module which holds language keys.

How does this sample work?

By default, our ResourceBundleLoaderAnalyzerPlugin expands modules with content/Language.properties files to add a couple of provided capabilities:

bundle.symbolic.name
resource.bundle.base.name

Then, our deployed LanguageExtender scans modules with those capabilities to automatically register an associated ResourceBundleLoader.

You can use this to leverage and use keys from common language modules republishing an aggregate ResourceBundleLoader as your own in two different ways:
1. Via Components

You can simply get a reference to the registered service in your components as detailed in the Overriding a Modules Language Keys tutorial.

The main disadvantage of this approach is that it forces you to provide a specific implementation of ResourceBundleLoader, making it potentially harder to modularize in the future.


2. Via Provide Capability

The same LanguageExtender that registers the services supports an extended syntax that allows you to register an aggregate of a collection of bundles as your own declaratively.

-liferay-aggregate-resource-bundles: \
	blade.language

This last approach has the advantadge of easier extensibility. Only the common lang modules need to be built and redeployed when keys change for all modules using them to automatically pick up the changes while staying clear of implementation details.

You should deploy this sample with BLADE Language Web module to get the entire picture.
