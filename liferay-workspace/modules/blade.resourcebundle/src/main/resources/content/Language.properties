# TODO: Make sure that your IDE accepts this file as UTF-8 encoded
# or change the implementation of your custom ResourceBundle implementation
# as documented in the code in this sample.
#
# Then look up the localization keys in either Liferay's core or the 
# modules you'd like to change, add them here and translate them as you
# desire. You can use the same Language.properties file to introduce new and
# changed core- as well as module-translations. See the two classes in this
# sample.
# 
# If you're translating multiple languages, add the locale-code in Java-style
# to the filenames, e.g. Language_de.properties, Language_en_GB.properties.
#
# NOT SURE YET: The ResourceBundle implementation denotes a language - does it
# need to reflect the available translated languages? Why the duplication of
# creating the file AND declaring it in the component annotation?

test=WOOHOO!!!!!
